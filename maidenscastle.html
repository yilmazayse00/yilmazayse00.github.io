         <div align="center"><p style="font-size:160%"><i>Maiden's Castle (Kızkalesi, also known as Deniz kalesi) is a castle situated on a small island in Mersin Province of Turkey. Legend has it that once there was a king who had a beautiful daughter. At her birth, the palace soothsayer predicted the princess would die from a snake bite on her sixteenth birthday. To shield his daughter from harm, the king built a castle for her on the little island. On her sixteenth birthday, the princess received a basket of fruit in which was hidden a snake. The prophecy was fullfilled when the snake bit the princess and she died. To this day, the castle is called MaidenÂ´s Castle or Kizkalesi.
