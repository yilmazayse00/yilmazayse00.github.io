     <div align="center"><p style="font-size:160%"><i>Egyptian queen named Kleopatra Gate VII. The area from Cleopatra is a city gate in Tarsus that is the town of Mersin. Tarsus was enclosed by a pair of concentric defense walls. According to 17th century-Turkish traveler Evliya Çelebi, there were three gates; a mountain gate to Toros Mountains in the north, a port gate to the Mediterranean coastline in the south and the Adana Gate to the neighbouring city of Adana in the east. In 1835, the walls were demolished by Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt, following the Egyptian–Ottoman War of 1831–1833. Only the port gate survived up to the present time, albeit because of alluvial deposits from the rivers Berdan and Seyhan, the coastline is currently 15 kilometres south of the port gate.
