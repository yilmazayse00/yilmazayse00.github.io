         <div align="center"><p style="font-size:160%"><i> Since the construction of the Berdan Dam, the water of the Tarsus River has been distributed in canals for irrigation, with the result that the waterfall can now be seen only in seasons of very heavy rainfall.
        The Berdan River, which plays an important role in the emergence of the Çukurova delta with alluviums it carries, comes from the rivers of the southeastern slopes of the Central Taurus Mountains (Bolkar Mountains). Unlike Seyhan and Ceyhan rivers, Çukurova goes a short way to the Mediterranean. The most important of the rivers that form the total length of 142 km are the branches of Can, Cotton and Kusun. Berdan (ancient Kydnos), who made wide springs in Tarsus rubble before being cast into the Mediterranean, is also an important choice in the establishment of Tarsus at the same time. Berdan, which means cold water, also has a natural beauty 4 km north of the city. While the bed was changed by the Byzantine emperor Justinyen (M.S. 527-565), it actually turned into a large, high pagoda in the necropolis used until the end of the Roman period. At the end of this study, which is designed to protect the city from floods, today the water spilling from the conglomerate rocks about 15 m high reaches its peak, especially during the winter and spring months. Today, stepped or rampic (dromos) chamber tombs in the necropolis are severely damaged by the weakness of the conglomerate rocks they have carved and their failure to counteract the strong current. Today, the waterfall and its surroundings are at the top of the places where Tarsus has an interest especially on hot summer days.
