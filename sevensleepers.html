Ashab-Kehf, which has four caves in our country and a total of 33 caves in the world, exists in many beliefs. The story of an immortal sleep has spread throughout the history of the country and has come up to daylight with some cultural heritage. What is this Ashab-i-keh?<br>
The stories are the same in many ways, even though they are told differently in many peoples and societies: Seven members of the group who have escaped from their communities or turned their backs on their communities have been harmonious for centuries ... Based on the story of Seven Sleepers, Christianity is based on the story of seven people, 'take the name. Another detail of the story is that the puppets followed by these people (the name of Islam in Kithmir) went to cennete.
<br>Seven Sleepers in Islam:


In the Qur'an, the Seven Sleepers, which lasted for a long time, took place in the Surat al-Kahf as Ashab al-Kahf. In the holy book, however, there is nothing definite about the reality of the event. According to the story:

Six people named Yemliha, Mekselina, Mislina, Mernuş, Debernuş and Şazenuş who live in the city of Afşin change their religion by leaving paganism. However, the ruler does not accept it and wants to make pagans. Six youngsters refuse to enforce this and escape from the kingdom and keep a path to the mountain to worship. At this time, the shepherd named Kefeştetayyuş and his dog Kıtmir join the young people and form the Seven Uyulars.

The Seven Sleepers approaching the mountain enter a cave. They pray in the cave and beg for mercy. At that time the soldiers of the ruler imprisoned these young men into the cave and left them to die. This grandfather is like a night out in a deep sleep between 300-309 years. Yemliha, who sets out to come down to the city, finds something different when he sees a different city in front of him. After meeting with the ruler and telling the events, he tells him that he does not get sleepy, he wants to sleep again and he sleeps again with his friends. People who thought it was a miracle then honored the Seven Uyulars by making a mosque in front of the cave.

The most frequently visited caves in Afşin, Selçuk, Ephesus, Lice and Tarsus in our country are known as Ashab-i Kehf in Tarsus. There is also a species called 'Seven Brothers' in Adana.
